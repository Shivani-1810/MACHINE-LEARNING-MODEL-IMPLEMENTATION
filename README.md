DESCRIPTION
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based text classification model that identifies whether a given message is spam or ham (not spam). Using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, the model is trained with labeled SMS messages and predicts the class of new messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
The model is built using the Scikit-learn library, leveraging the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithmâ€”a commonly used classifier for text data. This task is part of the CODTECH Internship Task - 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation.
